This markdown is a workflow for grabbing a list of all the user-installed packages in your R environment and then reinstalling them after the new R has been installed. This serves as a backup in case the built-in transfer process doesn't work properly. 

```{r}
# load packages
library(rmsfuns)

load <- c("dplyr", "readr")
load_pkg(load)
```


Before the new R is installed, let's get the full list of user-isntalled packages and save this list somewhere:
```{r}
# could be improved for easier reading
ip <- as.data.frame(installed.packages()[,c(1,3:4)])
rownames(ip) <- NULL

ip <- ip[is.na(ip$Priority),1:2,drop=FALSE]
print(ip, row.names=FALSE)

write_csv(ip, "package_list.csv")
```


```{r}

```
